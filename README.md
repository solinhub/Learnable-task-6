This JavaScript code uses RegEx to validate credit card numbers and identify their types. Each credit card type has a corresponding regex pattern. Here's a brief explanation of the regex patterns:

- *Discover*: Starts with 6011 followed by 12 digits.
- *Visa*: Starts with a 4 followed by 12 or 15 digits, optionally followed by 3 additional digits.
- *Mastercard*: Starts with a 5 followed by a digit between 1 and 5, followed by 14 digits.
- *China UnionPay*: Starts with 62 followed by 14 to 17 digits.
- *American Express*: Starts with either 34 or 37 followed by 13 digits.
- *JCB*: Starts with 2131, 1800, or 35, followed by 3 digits (representing JCB card prefix), followed by 11 digits.
- *RuPay*: Follows a combination of patterns for various Rupay card formats.

If the input card number matches any of these patterns, the function returns _'Valid (corresponding card type) card number'_. If none of the patterns matched, the function returns _'Invalid card number'_.
